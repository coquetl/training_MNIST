# MNIST dataset Classification

Using the MNIST dataset to make classification using classic machine learning techniques.  
Project inspired and using parts of code from Chapter 3 & 7 of "Hands On Machine Learning" of Aurelien Geron.  
  
Concepts and methods used:  
- Data preprocessing
- Models: SVM, Random Forest/Extra Trees, KNN, Kmeans
- Ensemble methods: Voting Classifier, Stacking
- Tarining set expansion with shifts
- Model training and selection, cross validation, Grid search method
- Evaluation on test set
